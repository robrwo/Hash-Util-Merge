# NAME

Hash::Util::Merge - utility functions for merging hashes

# VERSION

version v0.1.3

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Hash::Util::Merge qw/ mergemap /;

my %a = ( x => 1, y => 2 );
my %b = ( x => 3, y => 7 );

my $c = mergemap { $a + $b } \%a, \%b;

# %c = ( x => 4, y => 9 );
```

# DESCRIPTION

This module provides some syntactic sugar for merging simple
hashes with a function.

# EXPORTS

None by default.

## mergemap

```
$hashref = mergemap { fn($a,$b) } \%a, \%b;
```

For each key in the hashes `%a` and `%b`, this function applies the
user-supplied function `fn` to the corresponding values of that key,
in the resulting hash reference.

If a key does not exist in either of the hashes, then it will return
`undef`.

# KNOWN ISSUES

[Readonly](https://metacpan.org/pod/Readonly) hashes, or those with locked keys, may return an error
when merged with a hash that has other keys.
